# About Skibs
## Inspiration
We all usually encounter a time when you call somebody and when you've not even finished your discussion. The other person (or you) have to leave because they are not free at that moment. Therefore, that is where the main inspiration of **Skibs** came from!
## What I learned
Every single app that you make comes packed with new knowledge, same with this one! I learned about making Firebase authentication from scratch and how to create a wonderful UI too. Later on I discovered Firestore to store the Free Time and the email to the cloud (which was really cool). At nearly the end I learned about TabViews and how to make them swipe able to make it look clean.
## How I built my project
I made my project using SwiftUI, I chose SwiftUI and not Storyboards because in SwiftUI it was a whole lot easier to make clean and pleasing views. Also, I user the FirebaseAuth SPM (Swift Package Manager) and Firestore SPM in order to Authenticate the user and store data respectively. 

## Challenges I faced
Firstly, I was stuck because the login screen was not transitioning to the schedules screen. After hours of debugging I finally knew that I had to put the whole login system in the contentView not in a different file. Secondly, I was not able to fetch the data from Firestore and then keep them in a variable. After an 30min or so I had found out the solution for that too! Last but **surely not least!** I had badly encountered an error and my data was not showing in the swipe able tab view. I was stuck for 2 Days, I had tried out every single thing I knew but then I knew I had to put only foreach and somehow I fixed the problem!
